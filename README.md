## Project Description

This project focuses on **Helmet Detection** using a deep learning model. The model is trained on a custom dataset and can perform detection tasks on both **images** and **videos**. The project is built with machine learning tools and includes:

- Training the model with a custom dataset
- Evaluating the model performance
- Running inference for image and video-based detection

## Installation

To replicate this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Helmet_Detection.git
   cd Helmet_Detection
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:  
   Ensure the required libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, etc.) are installed in your environment. Install missing libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell in sequence:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Helmet_Detection(Complete).ipynb
   ```
